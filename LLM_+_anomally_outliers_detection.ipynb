            "### Possible Causes of Outliers:\n",
            "1. **Temperature Sensor Malfunction:**\n",
            "   - It’s possible that the temperature sensors used to collect the data were malfunctioning or experiencing temporary errors.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **External Factors:**\n",
            "   - Sudden changes in external conditions, such as a heatwave, could momentarily impact the machine's operating temperature.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Operational Conditions:**\n",
            "   - Unexpected operational scenarios, like overloading or mechanical failures, might cause the machine to operate outside of its normal temperature range. \n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Calibration Issues:**\n",
            "   - The sensors may not have been calibrated correctly, leading to inaccurate readings.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Suggested Actions:\n",
            "1. **Sensor Check:**\n",
            "   - Inspect and test the sensors for functionality and accuracy. Replace or recalibrate as needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Data Validation:**\n",
            "   - Reassess the data acquisition system to ensure it is properly recording and processing the temperature data without disruptions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Review Operational Procedures:**\n",
            "   - Analyze the operating conditions during the periods when the outlier readings occurred. Review whether any unusual operations or maintenance tasks were being performed.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Investigation:**\n",
            "   - Conduct a deeper investigation into the conditions leading up to the outliers. This could involve looking at machine logs, maintenance records, or environmental changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Regular Monitoring:**\n",
            "   - Implement regular monitoring and routine checks on temperature data to identify trends or potential patterns in temperature fluctuations over time. \n",
            "\n",
            "By following these actions, you can better manage and mitigate the risks associated with temperature outliers and enhance the reliability of your machine's operations.\n"
